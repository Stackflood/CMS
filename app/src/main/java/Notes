Bundle is most often used for passing
data through various Activities.
Provides putType() and getType() methods
 for storing and retrieving data from it.

An Intent is exactly what it describes. It's an "intention" to do an action.

An Intent is basically a message to say you did or want something to happen. Depending on the intent, apps or the OS might be listening for it and will react accordingly.

Think of it as a blast email to a bunch of friends, in which you tell your friend John to do something. The other folks will ignore the email, but John will react to it.

To listen for an intent (like the phone ringing, or an SMS is received), you implement a broadcast receiver.

If you want to fire off an intent to do something, like pop up the dialer, you fire off an intent saying you will.

intent-based calls are run-time binding.

intent-based invocations are asynchronous.

An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities. It is basically a passive data structure
 holding an abstract description of an action to be performed.

 action -- The general action to be performed, such as ACTION_VIEW, ACTION_EDIT, ACTION_MAIN, etc.

 data -- The data to operate on, such as a person record in the contacts database, expressed as a Uri.

     HANDLERS :
     http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html

     A Handler allows you to send and process Message and Runnable
      objects associated with a thread's MessageQueue. Each Handler instance is
      associated with a single thread and that thread's message queue.
      When you create a new Handler, it is bound to the thread / message queue of the
      thread that is creating it -- from that point on, it will deliver messages and
      runnables to that message queue and execute them as they come out of the message queue.

     There are two main uses for a Handler: (1) to schedule messages and runnables
     to be executed as some point in the future; and (2) to enqueue an action to be
     performed on a different thread than your own.

     Scheduling messages is accomplished with the post(Runnable), postAtTime(Runnable, long),
      postDelayed(Runnable, long), sendEmptyMessage(int), sendMessage(Message),
      sendMessageAtTime(Message, long), and sendMessageDelayed(Message, long) methods.
      The post versions allow you to enqueue Runnable objects to be called by the message
       queue when they are received; the sendMessage versions allow you to enqueue a
       Message object containing a bundle of data that will be processed

     by the Handler's handleMessage(Message) method (requiring that you implement a
     subclass of Handler).

     When posting or sending to a Handler, you can either allow the item to
<<<<<<< HEAD
      be processed as soon as the message queue is ready to do so, or specify a delay before it gets processed or
      absolute time for it to be processed. The latter two allow you to implement timeouts, ticks, and other timing-based behavior.

     When a process is created for your application, its main thread is dedicated to
     running a message queue that takes care of managing the top-level application
      objects (activities, broadcast receivers, etc) and any windows they create.
       You can create your own threads, and communicate back with the main application
       thread through a Handler. This is done by calling the same post or
        sendMessage methods as before, but from your new thread.
        The given Runnable or Message will then be scheduled in
        the Handler's message queue and processed when appropriate.

 Example of RELATIVE LAYOUTS

 http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/relative.html


 --> Frame is not available

 Issue doing database access such as :

 Cursor c = db.query(CATEGORIES_TABLE, new String[]


 -->
 To go to next activity : startActivityForResult-- using intent
 i=intent
 r= request code
 startActivityForResult(i,r);

 getting back :
 setResult(RESULT_OK, mIntent);
                     finish();


 ---> ViewStub

<<<<<<< HEAD
 The < include /> will just include the xml contents in your base xml file as if the whole thing was just a single big file. Itï¿½s a nice way to share layout parts between different layouts.The < ViewStub /> is a bit different because it is not directly included, and will be loaded only when you actually use it/need it, i.e, when you set itï¿½s visibility to ï¿½trueï¿½. This a nice optimization because you could have a complex layout with tons of small views or headers anywhere, and still have your Activity load up really fast.
  Once you use one of those views, itï¿½ll be loaded.

  ----> Broadcast

  A broadcast receiver (short receiver) is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events.
  All registered receivers for an event are notified by the Android runtime once this event happens.

  ---> Android Video Uploader has problems - --- > all versions


----> FrameLayout

FrameLayout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item.
Generally, FrameLayout should be used to hold a single child view, because it can be difficult to organize child views in a way that's
scalable to different screen sizes without the children overlapping each other.
 You can, however, add multiple children to a FrameLayout and control their position within the FrameLayout
  by assigning gravity to each child, using the android:layout_gravity attribute.

Child views are drawn in a stack, with the most recently added child on top. The size of the FrameLayout is the size of its largest child (plus padding), visible or not (if the FrameLayout's parent permits). Views that are GONE are used for sizing only if setConsiderGoneChildrenWhenMeasuring() is set to true.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Letï¿½s move from the top to the bottom. At very beginning of the fragment life the method onInflate is called. We have to notice that this method is called only if we define fragment directly in our layout using the tag <fragment>. In this method we can save some configuration parameter and some attributes define in the XML layout file. After this step onAttach is called. This method is called as soon as the fragment is ï¿½attachedï¿½ to the ï¿½fatherï¿½ activity and we can this method to store the reference about the activity. After it we have onCreate. It is one of the most important step, our fragment is in the creation process. This method can be used to start some thread to retrieve data information, maybe from a remote server. The onCreateView is the method called when the fragment has to create its view hierarchy. During this method we will inflate our layout inside the fragment as we do for example in the ListView widget. During this phase we canï¿½t be sure that our activity is still created so we canï¿½t count on it for some operation. We get notified when the ï¿½fatherï¿½ activity is created and ready in the onActivityCreated. From now on, our activity is active and created and we can use it when we need. The next step is onStart method. Here we do the common things as in the activity onStart, during this phase our fragment is visible but it isnï¿½t still interacting with the user.When the fragment is ready to interact with user onResume is called. At the end of this phase our fragment is up and running!!
Then it can happen that the activity is paused and so the activityï¿½s onPause is called. Well onPause fragment method is called too. After it it can happen that the OS decides to destroy our fragment view and so onDestroyView is called. After it, if the system decides to dismiss our fragment it calls onDestroy method. Here we should release all the connection active and so on because our fragment is close to die. Even if it is during the destroy phase it is still attached to the father activity. The last step is detach the fragment from the activity and it happens when onDetach is called.

--> BaseAdapter

public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)
actaully creates the view where you bind your custom layout


getView() is called for each item in the list you pass to your adapter.
 It is called when you set adapter. When getView() is finished the next line after setAdapter(myAdapter) is called.
  In order to debug getView() you must toggle a breakpoint on it because you can't step into getView() from setAdapter(myAdapter).
   getView() is also called after notifyDataSetChanged() and on scrolling.

To be more clear, getView() is called whenever a new item is displayed on screen,
at the count of displayed items. Which means, if you have 1 million items but 15 of them fits on screen,
getView is called 15 times. Whenever you scroll up/down and new items appear, getView() is called for new ones.
 And you should be aware of recycler mechanism, too. Which holds a template item layout for each item type,
 and sends in this view to getView() method as convertView parameter, so you could use it in order to prevent layout inflation.

-- > invalidateOptionsMenu

This function tell android that it should redraw the menu. By default, once the menu is created, it won't be redrawn every frame (since that would be useless to redraw the same menu over and over again).

You sould call this function when you changed something in the option menu (added an element, deleted an element or changed a text). This way android will know that it's time te redraw the menu and your change will appear.

Hope this answers your question

-- > startSupportActionMode(Callback)


Callback interface for action modes.
Supplied to startSupportActionMode(Callback) (Callback)}, a Callback configures and handles events raised by a user's interaction with an action mode.


An action mode's lifecycle is as follows:

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/view/ActionMode.Callback.html

onCreateActionMode(ActionMode, Menu) once on initial creation
onPrepareActionMode(ActionMode, Menu) after creation and any time the ActionMode is invalidated
onActionItemClicked(ActionMode, MenuItem) any time a contextual action button is clicked
onDestroyActionMode(ActionMode) when the action mode is closed

-- > Service and threads

A thread should be used in a long running process that would block the UI from updating. If it's more than a second or two you might
want to put it into a background thread and notify the user with a dialog or spinner or something. If you lock the UI thread for more
 than 5 seconds the user will be prompted with a kill or wait option by the OS.

A service does not run on separate thread, so it will block the UI, but you can spawn a new thread within a service. A service is
 used more for something that should happen on an interval or keep running/checking for something when there is no UI shown.
